Make your script an executable

chmod +x myscript.py
Run the nohup command to execute the script in the background. The & option ensures that the process stays alive after exiting. I've added the shebang line to my python script so there's no need to call python here

nohup /path/to/script/myscript.py &
Logout from the shell if you want

logout
Done! Now your script is up and running. You can login back and make sure that your process is still alive by checking the output of this command:

ps -e | grep myscript.py
If anything went wrong, you can check out the nohup.out file to see the output of your script:

cat nohup.out
